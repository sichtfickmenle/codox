If you love making mashups, remixes, or covers of songs, you might have wondered how to extract the vocals from a song and create an acapella. An acapella is a track that contains only the vocals of a song, without any instruments or background noises. Acapellas are useful for creating new versions of songs, mixing different genres, or adding your own twist to a song.
  
However, finding acapellas online can be challenging, especially for less popular songs or songs that do not have official instrumentals. That's why you might want to learn how to make your own acapellas using a software called Utagoe.

## What is Utagoe?
  
Utagoe is a free software that allows you to remove the instrumentals of a song and get a clear vocal track. It works by inverting the waveform of the instrumental and aligning it with the original track to cancel out the sounds from the instruments. This leaves you with only the vocals of the song.
  
Utagoe is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job of extracting the vocals. You will need the exact instrumentals used in the song for Utagoe to work. You can't use fan-made instrumentals because they do not have the exact waveforms of the original track.
