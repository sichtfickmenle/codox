## Voice Chat Volume Problems
 
Another issue that some players have encountered is low or distorted voice chat volume in Resident Evil 6. This issue was also fixed by the same patch that was released on March 29, 2013[^1^]. However, if you still have voice chat problems after updating the game, you can try the following steps:
 
- Go to the game's options menu and adjust the voice chat volume slider.
- Make sure your microphone and speakers are working properly and are not muted.
- Check your Steam settings and make sure your voice input and output devices are set correctly.
- Disable any background applications that may interfere with your voice chat, such as Skype, Discord, etc.

## Monitor Display Frequency Reset
 
Some players have reported that their monitor display frequency is reset to 60 Hz every time they launch Resident Evil 6. This issue was also fixed by the same patch that was released on March 29, 2013[^1^]. However, if you still have this issue after updating the game, you can try the following steps:

- Go to your Steam library and right-click on Resident Evil 6.
- Select Properties and then click on Set Launch Options.
- Type -refresh <your desired="" frequency=""> (for example, -refresh 75) and click OK.</your>
- Launch the game and check if your monitor display frequency is correct.

## Missing steam\_api.dll File
 
Some players have reported that they get an error message saying that steam\_api.dll is missing when they try to run Resident Evil 6. This file is part of the Steamworks API and is required for the game to work properly. To fix this issue, you need to download the steam\_api.dll file from a reliable source and place it in your game folder. You can download the file from here[^3^]. After downloading the file, follow these steps:

- Extract the file from the .rar archive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
- Copy the file and paste it in your game folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resident Evil 6).
- Launch the game and check if the error is gone.
