UoPilot v2.17 is based on the source code of UoPilot 0.96 beta by Blade[^1^]. It has a simple and clear interface that allows you to create and edit scripts with syntax highlighting. You can also record your mouse movements and clicks and play them back later. You can assign hotkeys to start and stop the program, as well as to pause and resume the script execution.
 
UoPilot v2.17 supports many online games, such as Ultima Online, Lineage 2, World of Warcraft, MU Online, and more[^2^]. However, you should be careful when using it, as some game developers may consider it as cheating and ban your account. Therefore, you should use it at your own risk and only for good or peaceful purposes[^1^]. The program is not intended to harm anyone or anything.
 
UoPilot v2.17 is compatible with Windows 10, 7, 8/8.1 (64 bit/32 bit). You can download it for free from the official website[^2^] or from other sources[^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. However, you should always scan the file with an antivirus before running it, as some downloads may contain malware or viruses.
 
UoPilot v2.17 is a great tool for gamers who want to save time and effort while playing online games. It can also be useful for other tasks that require repetitive mouse clicks or keyboard strokes. However, you should use it responsibly and ethically, as it may violate some game rules or laws. If you are interested in trying it out, you can download it from the links below.
  
## How to Use UoPilot v2.17

After installing it, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see the main window of the program, which consists of four tabs: Script, Record, Options, and Help.
 
The Script tab is where you can create and edit your scripts. A script is a set of commands that tell the program what to do. You can write your own script using the built-in editor, or you can load a pre-made script from a file. You can also save your script to a file for later use. The editor supports syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error checking. You can also insert variables, functions, and comments to make your script more flexible and readable.
 
The Record tab is where you can record and play back your mouse movements and clicks. This is useful if you don't want to write a script or if you want to capture a specific action in a game. To record your mouse actions, click on the Record button and then perform the actions you want to automate. To stop recording, click on the Stop button. You can then play back your recording by clicking on the Play button. You can also save your recording to a file or load it from a file.
 
The Options tab is where you can customize the settings of the program. You can change the language, the hotkeys, the speed, the transparency, and other options. You can also enable or disable some features, such as logging, sound effects, and error messages.
