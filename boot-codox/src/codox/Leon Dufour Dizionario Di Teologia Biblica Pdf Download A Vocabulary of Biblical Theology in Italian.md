## How is Leon Dufour Dizionario Di Teologia Biblica Pdf Download organized?
  
Leon Dufour Dizionario Di Teologia Biblica Pdf Download follows a historical-critical approach to biblical theology.

The dictionary adopts a chronological-historical schema for its entries. This means that it traces the evolution and transformation of each theme or concept throughout the different stages and periods of biblical history. For example, the entry on "God" starts with the pre-biblical notions of divinity in ancient Near Eastern cultures, then moves to the patriarchal traditions of Israel's ancestors, then to the Mosaic revelation at Sinai, then to the prophetic critique of idolatry and injustice, then to the wisdom literature's reflection on God's transcendence and immanence, then to the New Testament's proclamation of God's self-revelation in Jesus Christ and his Spirit.
  
The dictionary also pays attention to the semantic and doctrinal aspects of each theme or concept. This means that it analyzes not only what each term means in its original context and language, but also how it relates to other terms and concepts in the biblical canon. It also explores how each theme or concept has been interpreted and applied by later Christian traditions and communities.
