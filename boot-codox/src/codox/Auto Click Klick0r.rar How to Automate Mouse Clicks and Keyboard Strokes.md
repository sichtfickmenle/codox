# How to Install Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a UEFI BIOS with GPT
 
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit is one of the most popular versions of Windows that supports UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) for modern hardware. UEFI is a replacement for the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) that provides more features and security. GPT is a partitioning scheme that allows for larger and more flexible disk management. However, installing Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a UEFI BIOS with GPT can be tricky and requires some preparation and steps. Here is a guide on how to do it.
 
## Step 1: Prepare your installation media
 
You will need a Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit installation DVD or USB flash drive. If you have a DVD, you can skip this step. If you have an ISO file, you will need to create a bootable USB flash drive using a tool like Rufus or Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. However, not all ISO files are compatible with UEFI and GPT, so you may need to modify the ISO file using a tool like UltraISO or WinISO. The modification involves adding an EFI folder with some files to the ISO image. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on various online forums[^1^] [^3^]. Alternatively, you can download a modified ISO file from reputable sources[^4^].

- Disable Secure Boot, which is a feature that prevents unauthorized bootloaders from running.
- Enable UEFI mode, which is the mode that supports GPT and EFI bootloaders. Depending on your BIOS, this may be called "Windows 8 Compatibility", "UEFI", "UEFI or Legacy OS", or something similar[^1^] [^2^]. Avoid using "CSM" or "Legacy" mode, which is the mode that supports MBR and BIOS bootloaders.
- Set the boot order or priority to boot from your DVD or USB flash drive first.
- Save and exit the BIOS settings.

## Step 3: Install Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
 
After you boot from your installation media, you will see the Windows Setup screen. Follow the instructions until you reach the screen where you can choose where to install Windows. Here, you will need to do the following:

- Delete any existing partitions on your disk, if any. This will erase all data on your disk, so make sure you have backed up anything important.
- Create a new partition for Windows using the "New" button. You can choose any size you want, but make sure it is large enough for your needs. Windows will automatically create some additional partitions for EFI and recovery purposes.
- Select the partition where you want to install Windows and click "Next". Windows will start copying files and installing.
- Follow the rest of the instructions until Windows is installed and ready to use.

## Conclusion
 
Installing Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a UEFI BIOS with GPT is not as straightforward as installing it on a BIOS with MBR, but it is possible and has some advantages. You will need to prepare your installation media, configure your BIOS settings, and follow some steps during the installation process. Once you have done that, you can enjoy your Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit system on your modern hardware.
