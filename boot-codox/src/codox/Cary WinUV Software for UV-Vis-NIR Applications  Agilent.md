## What is the Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer?
 
The Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer is a double-beam instrument that uses a powerful xenon lamp as the light source. The xenon lamp flashes 80 times per second, which means that it only illuminates the sample when data is acquired. This protects sensitive samples from photodegradation, and reduces power consumption and lamp replacement costs. The xenon lamp also has a 10-year replacement warranty for new instruments purchased from Agilent or participating partners.
 
The Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer has a wavelength range of 190â1100 nm that can be scanned in under three seconds. It can measure samples in various forms, such as liquids, solids, films, and optical components. It can also be fitted with long pathlength cuvettes and solid sample transmission or reflectance accessories, as well as fiber optic probes for remote UV-Vis absorbance analysis.
 
## How does the Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer work?
 
The Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer works by splitting the light beam from the xenon lamp into two beams: one that passes through the sample (sample beam) and one that passes through a reference (reference beam). The two beams are then recombined and detected by a photodiode array detector. The detector measures the intensity of the light at each wavelength and calculates the absorbance of the sample according to the Beer-Lambert law.
 
The Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer has a spectral bandwidth of 1.5 nm and a photometric range of up to 4 Abs. It can collect data from single or multiple wavelengths at 80 data points per second, which makes it suitable for monitoring fast reactions or kinetics. It can also perform various types of measurements, such as wavelength scans, concentration analysis, enzyme kinetics, RNA-DNA estimation, and more.
 
## What are the benefits of using the Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer?
 
Some of the benefits of using the Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer are:

- It delivers accurate and reliable results with minimal sample preparation and handling.
- It saves time and resources by scanning the entire wavelength range in seconds and having a long-lasting lamp.
- It preserves the integrity of sensitive samples by avoiding photodegradation and using small volumes.
- It offers flexibility and versatility by measuring different types of samples and being compatible with various accessories and software modules.
- It supports sustainability by reducing power consumption and waste generation.

## What are some of the applications for the Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer?
 
The Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer can be used for a wide range of applications in different fields, such as chemicals, academic research, biotech and pharma, food and agriculture, art conservation, and more. Some of the common applications are:

- Quality control of raw materials and finished goods
- Color measurements and color matching
- Analysis of nutrients in water, food, and agriculture
- Analysis of turbid solutions or relatively highly absorbing samples
- Analysis of bulk optics (e.g., sunglasses)
- Study of pigments in art conservation through reflectance measurements
- Characterization of unknown or newly synthesized compounds
- Monitoring kinetics of chemical or biological reactions that occur at sub-second rate
- Measurement of films and optical components
- Analyzing photochemical reactions in-situ during sample irradiation
- DNA and protein quantification
- Measuring cold biological samples (4 Â°C) immediately after removal from the refrigerator
- Preparation of fluorescent liquid samples before emission measurements
- Analyzing small amounts of precious sample (< 4 8cf37b1e13
